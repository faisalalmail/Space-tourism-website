### What I learned

I would say jumping from a standard 1 page style css structure to a multi-page format which requires more code refactoring makes it challenging. As usual, a thorough review of the design makes things easier along the way.

### Continued development

The next step is more CSS styling tricks, easier to read and refactor code.

### Useful resources

- [CSS grid generator](https://cssgrid-generator.netlify.app/) - This tool has always been a great help
